# Pokemon Application

## Description

The goal of this application is to filter pokemons by their types and extract statistics about every pokemon. Information about every pokemon was fetched from the PokeAPI. There are 3 important fragments in this pplication. First fragment is a page containing a spinner that has 10 type options : "Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, Dragon, Psychic, Ghost, Dark, Steel, and Fairy". After the type is selected the user is redirected in the second fragment. Second fragment contains a pokemon list of names and pictures of the 10 first pokemons of the selected type. Also, there is a load more button that loads 10 more pokemons and adds them to the list every time it is clicked. A search bar is, also, created and users can search for a pokemon of the selected type and (3 max) pokemons matching the search text will appear in a dropdown style. Finally, users can click on every pokemon name in second fragment and they will be redirected to a third fragment. Third fragment contains details about the selected pokemon. More specifically, it contains an image of the pokemon and its statistics about hp,attack and defence.
